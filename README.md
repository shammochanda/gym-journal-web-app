## GYM JOURNAL WEB APP

## Objectives

Have a full web-app (including authentication and backend) that keeps track of gym workouts/schedules/personal bests

## Current Progress (as of 10/7/22)

Most progress is UI related.

Some future backend stuff is now temporarily being run using redux, just to test functionality.

With most major UI related stuff out of the way, progress is expected to be faster (expected finish 10/10/22) for the rest of the project but this is a stanby to showcase UI abilities.
