## GYM JOURNAL WEB APP

## Objectives

Currently it is a functioning UI, authentication and  backend is still to be implemented.

Photograph integration still to be implemented.

Website is quite responsive, but minicard UI might need to be changed to make the web app more sleek, currently slightly cluttered.

(Future Plan is to make the photos the whole minicard)

Currently, all future backend functionality is implemented using Redux.
